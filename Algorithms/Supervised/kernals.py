# GLM vs kernals:
# GML:
#   work with fixed non-linear functions because of that the hypothesis is limited but in return easier to optimize and usually a convex:
# nural networks:
#   adaptive non-linear basis function
#   richer hypothesis space, but it will be harder to optimize and non-convex
# Kernel method use large or even infinite set of fixed non-linear basis function, normally the complexity depend on the basis of the function
# but there is a trick to make it depend on the amount of data, so small data set will work great
